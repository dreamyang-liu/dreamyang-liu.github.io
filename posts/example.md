# Getting Started with Markdown and LaTeX

This is an example blog post that demonstrates the Markdown and LaTeX support in this blog.

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Lists (like this one)
- Code blocks:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## LaTeX Support

You can include mathematical equations using LaTeX syntax:

Inline equations like $E = mc^2$ are supported.

You can also include display equations:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x)
$$

Here's another example of a complex equation:

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} & = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}} \\
\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \\
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\
\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0
\end{align}
$$

## Images

You can include images in your posts:

> It can span multiple lines.

## Tables

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

## Conclusion

This blog template makes it easy to write content with both Markdown and LaTeX support!

You can customize this template to fit your needs and add more features as required.
